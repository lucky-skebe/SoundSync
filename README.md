Ever wanted to play a game with buttplug vibration but the Game didnâ€™t support it?
Ever wanted to watch a certain Video with vibration but there were no Scriptfiles for it?

Fear no more!

I created a little program for myself that just makes a buttplug vibrate according to the volume of your PCs output using the buttplug server.
